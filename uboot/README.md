Yes, there's a binary file in here. It was built by \_Yoda on IRC (warpspeed.dk). In the future I'd like to compile this transparently somewhere. **I (njha) have not tested any of the information below this line!**

- This was compiled from the sources from pine64-org.gitlab.org.
- It has the latest patches for 3GB phone and Crust.
- It also contains support for Btrfs and EFI firmware, and can be used to boot plain Fedora Rawhide images.
- To update your uboot, copy both files to /boot directory, and run the script file **directly on the phone**.
- If you run the script in an SD card adapter on a PC, **be sure to change the path and the device name inside the script**.
